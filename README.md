# odin-recipes
Recipe project for the Odin Project
In this project I aim to learn the basics of HTML and learn how to apply what I had learned in my lessons in my project
This will give me insight on what I may be doing in future projects and how I would be able to create a project using what I learned
I will also be using commit messages to nestle what Ive done to show what I could have possible done wrong in the code
It will be a good way to time stamp for me so that I know exactly what minute or major changes I make within the code
